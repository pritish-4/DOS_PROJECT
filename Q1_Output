Project Description 2:
The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.
Example: Snapshot at the initial stage:
Choose the scheduling algorithm:
1. First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)
2. Round Robin (RR)
3. Terminate Program
2
Enter the number of processes: 5
Enter burst time for process 1: 10
Enter burst time for process 2: 1
Enter burst time for process 3: 2
Enter burst time for process 4: 1
Enter burst time for process 5: 5
Enter arrival time for process 1: 0
Enter arrival time for process 2: 1
Enter arrival time for process 3: 2
Enter arrival time for process 4: 3
Enter arrival time for process 5: 6
Enter the time quantum: 4
Processes Burst time Waiting time Turnaround time Response time
1 10 9 19 0 2 1 3 4 3
3 2 3 5 3
4 1 4 5 4
5 5 6 11 2
Average waiting time = 5.2
Average turnaround time = 8.8
Average response time = 2.4
Round Robin (RR) algorithm results in the minimum average waiting time = 5.2
